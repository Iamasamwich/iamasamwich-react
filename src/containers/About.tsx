        About Me
      </h2>
      <p><span>I</span> am a full stack web developer with a passion for JavaScript and a love of finding logical and elegant solutions to complex problems.</p>
      <p><span>Coming</span> from a Financial Services Operations background, I started to learn VBA in an attempt to streamline and automate daily processes and to try to move away from cutting and pasting in Excel. This introduction to coding piqued my interest, and I decided on a career change into software development.</p>
      <p><span>I</span> completed General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program, a crash course in web development giving an "enough to get by" introduction to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, and PostgreSQL.</p>
      <p><span>Since</span> then I have completed a Diploma in Website Development through Tafe Queensland, and have continued to develop my coding skills through my own projects, primarily focussing on Node, Express, React and MySQL while working as a freelance developer.</p>
      <p><span>When</span> I'm not in front of a computer I enjoy playing the guitar, swing dancing (pre-pandemic...), and cycling.</p>
